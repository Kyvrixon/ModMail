# ⚙️ Config

Rename `config.ts.example` → `config.ts`, then fill in values.  

The config is strongly typed to reduce the risk of errors, and TypeScript can be very confusing when it comes to errors. If you run into any issues, don't hesitate to open up a new issue in this repository and I'll do my best to help you out!
